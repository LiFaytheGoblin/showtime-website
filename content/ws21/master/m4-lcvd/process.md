#### Research
With medical apps it is especially important that they are based on scientific research.
We started by researching about Long Covid: How is the illness defined? How is it diagnosed? 
Which are possible symptoms, which are most common and how are they treated? 
How frequent is Long Covid? What could be the cause of Long Covid?

Some of our sources are:
* [Attributes and predictors of long COVID. Sudre et. al.. Nature Medicine. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01292-y)
* [The road to addressing Long Covid. Alwan. Science. 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg7113)
* [Treating patients with long COVID. Schreiber. Monitor on Psychology. 2021](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2021/07/treating-long-covid)
* [S1-Leitlinie Post-COVID/Long-COVID. Koczulla et. al.. AWMF online - Das Portal der wissenschaftlichen Medizin. 2021](https://www.awmf.org/uploads/tx_szleitlinien/020-027l_S1_Post_COVID_Long_COVID_2021-07.pdf)

Additionally, we read personal reports published by patients of Long Covid on 
social media platforms like Instagram or Tumblr. Although not scientific, these reports helped us 
get insights into the every day life, fears and wishes of patients. 

#### Personas 
From our combined research we extracted four personas. Here is a short summary for each of them.

* Sonja Sorgenvoll, 50, baker, recovered from Covid-19: "Do I have Long Covid or am I just going crazy?"
* Franz Frustriert, 22, student, Long Covid patient: "I'm sick of feeling so helpless. Suffering from brain fog I can't even focus on my studies anymore."
* Nils Nichternstgenommen, 30, teacher, Long Covid patient: "My colleagues don't take me seriousely. I just feel alone with Long Covid."
* Mona Motiviert, 40, project manager, Long Covid patient: "I won't let Long Covid get me down. What can I do to get well soon?"

#### User Stories
We collected the problems that our personas have and developed User Stories from them. 
Those we clustered into five main topics and prioritized them. Here are those User Stories that we focused on:
* information: 
  * As a patient of Long Covid I want to read about current scientific recommendations on how to handle Long Covid
  * As a patient of Long Covid I want to see easily understandable explanations on symptoms so I can better explain myself
* tracking:
  * As a patient of Long Covid I want to track my symptoms to get an overview over my symptoms and communicate them
  * As a patient of Long Covid I want to be reminded about positive development to stay motivated
  * As a patient I want to be notified when I should see a doctor
